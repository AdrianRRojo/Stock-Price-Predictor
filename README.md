# Stock-Price-Predictor

## Overview
---
The goal of this project is to make use of machine learning to, as accurately as possible, generete a future price prediction on the different companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Is this possible? The Stock market is often seen as highly volitale and unpredictable, but Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. Investors make predictions based on news, reports, and any other information that will help them make educated guess, we can, and will, design a similar algorithm that will help us make educated guesses.


## Goal this project is trying to achieve
--- 
The purpose of this project is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time.

## How we plan to do this
---
- We will be implementing a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm and Deep Learning models to generate predictions
  - What is LSTM? LSTM is an extension of Recurring Neueral Networks (RNN). " It is capable of processing the entire sequence of data, apart from single data points such as images. This finds application in speech recognition, machine translation, etc. LSTM is a special kind of RNN, which shows outstanding performance on a large variety of problems." - intellipaat.com @ https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-lstm/
 - We will be using Tensor Flow (https://www.tensorflow.org/), an open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.
 
  
 ## MVPS
 ---
 - [ ] Retrieve stock price data from Yahoo Finance
 - [ ] Generate a price prediction
 - [ ] Generate a line graph showing the current price projectory
 
 ## Stretch Goals
 ---
 - [ ] Allow for multipe types of graphs i.e a bar graph.
 - [ ] Deploy it live so that others may use this resource as well.
 - [ ] Allow for stocks outside of the NYSE and generate a prediction from those as well
